Ruby program to check whether single word entry is in the english language. Word list is forked from atebits and thanks to them and the contributors to the original project, visit the GitHub here: (https://github.com/atebits/Words)

From the atebits Github:

  The word list behind [Letterpress](http://www.atebits.com/letterpress/). Loosely based on a collection of other word lists with refinements from real-world feedback. I hope this is useful for other word-based-app makers, and as a way to improve Letterpress.
